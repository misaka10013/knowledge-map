The image above is an [interactive mind map that can be viewed and explored](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#-48.5,-680.3,-1) and [searched through](http://learn-anything.xyz/).  🔎

When you click on any of the nodes in it, it will show you the best step by step guides you can use to learn the subject in depth.

If you think that there is a better way one can learn the subject or you wish something was added or you found a mistake, you can help improve it. There is a [note attached](http://i.imgur.com/XR6KpRL.png) in all of the mind maps which will link to a GitHub issue where you can propose to improve it. 💙


# [Search Engine 🔎](http://learn-anything.xyz)

<img width="600" alt="img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stylekit/img/master/i_want_to_learn.mp4.gif">

There is also a [fully open source](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine) [search engine](http://learn-anything.xyz) available that will jump to any point in [this mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#-48.5,-680.3,-1). 🚀

You can bookmark it in your browser or [set it as a home page](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95314?hl=en) to open every time you open a new tab if you wish to learn something new. You can also open a new tab, type 'le', press enter and type what you want to learn if you you've been on the page before. 📚

# [Community](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) 👬

Both this project and the search engine [is in active development](https://ducksource.github.io/). If you want to help improve this project in any way or want to join an ever growing community of learners, you can join our active [slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) where you can either help with expanding content of the mind maps, help with the development and adding features to the [search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine) or create a study group for any branch in the mind map and learn together.

We use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/knowledge_map) to announce new things like new queries that were added, [blog articles](https://ducksource.github.io) that were written and more. 🐦

# [Wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/wiki) 📚

This is a work in progress wiki that attempts to state all the goals and aspirations of this project. 

# Documentation 📘
 
There are many layers to this mind map and underlied nodes are hyperlinks. You may see emojis attached to some nodes. Here is what they mean :

|  emoji	|  meaning  | 
|---	|---	|
|  🗺	|  it is another mind map  | 
|  📝	| it is a course	| 
|  📖	|  it is a free book | 
|  📕	| it is not a free book  (and you either have to search online or buy it) |
|  📄 	| it is a research paper  |
|  👀|  it is a video or a talk  |
|  🖋️	|  it is an article  |
| 🗃️ 	|  it is a blog	 |
| 🌐 	|  it is a wiki article  |
|  🐙	|  it is a github page  |
|  👾	| it is interactive  (can be a tutorial or some presentation) |
| 🎙️ 	|  it is a podcast  |
|  📮	|  it is a newsletter |
| 🗣️ 	|  it is a chat	 (either a slack channel, discord server or similar) |
|  🎥	|  it is a youtube channel  |
| 🤖 	|  it is a reddit thread or comment  |


The arrows often represent relations. So if 'physics' has an arrow pointing to 'mathematics', it means that physics is related to it. Other times, arrows show direction and are used as a guide as can be seen [here](https://my.mindnode.com/zRGj6Bjd1T31sVhsJz4HcNbCCz7ZMgKNqJSWSjyt#392.4,-184.2,2).

Certain nodes have a number attached to them which represent the order in which the material should ideally be covered. If nodes have the same number, then choose any as all may be good for learning at this level.

Certain nodes may have a numeric prefix like '17: ' which stands for the year in which the article/research paper was written or published in. '17: ' means that it was written in 2017. I abbreviate it for visual clarity.

The contents of the main nodes can also be [viewed in text if you prefer that](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/study-plans) although they may not always be up-to-date.

# Contributing 👬

If you want to help make this dream of visualising all of world's knowledge in this way a reality, you can help in many ways.

## Help with improving the mind maps 🗺

Take some time to explore [the mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#-48.5,-680.3,0) or just search through topics you would like to learn with the [search engine](http://learn-anything.xyz).

- Do you think some topic can be covered in a more efficient way? 
- Or perhaps something can be added to deepen the understanding of the topic? 
- Or the order with how material should be tackled should be different?
- Or you wish some other topic was covered that is not currently included?

As mentioned above, there is a [note attached](http://i.imgur.com/XR6KpRL.png) in all of the mind maps which will link to a GitHub issue where you can propose to improve the mind map.

Just say what you wish was added or removed or changed and why. The content has to be of value and free content is preferred. 

If you wish to extend any of the mind maps in any way, you can can also say that in the issue appropriate to the mind map as each mind map has a corresponding issue on this GitHub page. 

If you want to propose a completely new mind map or have some other question or feedback that you don't want to ask in our [slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ), you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/issues/new) and say what you wish was added.

We are experimenting with easier ways on can contribute and in future [each mind map will have source code representation](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/wiki/Future-of-Knowledge) that one can edit and submit a pull request but for now this is the best way to curate and improve these mind maps.

It is also best to get to know the goals and aspirations of this project before contributing, so please read through the [short wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/wiki). 📚

## Help with developing the search engine for mind maps on the web 🔎 

We are very [heavily experimenting](https://ducksource.github.io/) with ways we can improve the [search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine) for these mind maps. 

We are attempting to [render mind maps on the same page](https://ducksource.github.io/internet/tech/2017/05/15/node-map.html) as the search engine so the search is always within reach. There is a lot of interesting and technical problems that come with that. If you are excited about mind maps and visulisation, please  join [our slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) and we can discuss ideas together.

We are also trying to create a [human curated backend](https://ducksource.github.io/internet/tech/2017/05/15/human-curated-backend.html) for all these mind maps. We plan to represent mind maps as JSON files that all can edit and test for themselves. One should be able to clone any of the mind maps and extend in any way they like and then submit pull requests to further improve this Knowledge Map that all will be able to explore or searh through with the search engine.

Once again, there is a lot of very interesting problems that need to be solved to achieve this. If you want to help, write to us on [slack](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ).


# [More Mind Maps 🗺️](https://my.mindnode.com/YyJtZap3S6BLzLq8FvBqcDM1fpzom5JfeXripa9w#149.7,-355.4,2)

In the mind map above, you will find a [little node](https://my.mindnode.com/YyJtZap3S6BLzLq8FvBqcDM1fpzom5JfeXripa9w#149.7,-355.4,2) named 'more' which acts as a gateway to all the research I do.

It contains :

- [all the interesting books you can read](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/books/) 
	- where if a book is free, a link will be provided
- [interesting courses one can take](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/courses/)
- [research papers on various topics](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/research-papers/)
- [interesting humans who ever lived](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/humans/)
- [inventions and historical events](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/history/)
- [interesting images](https://my.mindnode.com/mTasm9Ay8VtFs7fHRPDUSdEMqHExtjpcgwjBeUTC#108.8,-1795.2,-2)
- [interesting websites](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map/research/websites/)
- and [more](https://my.mindnode.com/YyJtZap3S6BLzLq8FvBqcDM1fpzom5JfeXripa9w#0.3,-513.6,2) 

All together there is currently [~ 3000 mind maps](http://i.imgur.com/Mb0tpVw.png). Aside from a pretty amazing [search engine for them](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine), there is also [an alfred workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map) that allows you to search through these mind maps at [insane speeds](http://quick.as/b1gwsneao).

As I learn more and more topics, I also make [flash cards](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research/tree/master/anki) that I use to consolidate this knowledge.

This project started off as a [single mind map](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3bsw537ggy7u0zf/original.png?dl=1) but it grew too big.


# Future 🚀

We [plan to ease the contributing process](https://ducksource.github.io/internet/tech/2017/05/15/human-curated-backend.html) as much as possible so there is no friction in proposing to add changes and integrating them into the mind maps. 

The focus of the search engine is to search through an [open index of knowledge that all can see and explore and contribute to](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/wiki/Future-of-Knowledge). It should categorise knowledge in a way that allows linear progression of learning each of the topics. There should be no black box where everything is hidden behind a search bar, if you want to explore, [you can](https://my.mindnode.com/KdeMPbxs8KPixsa5YUq5cphqJnQg81vpHaXcDX2i#-48.5,-680.3,0). 

The end goal is to make an interactive mind map of all of world's knowledge that all can explore.

# [Keep this project going 🎊](https://www.patreon.com/nikitavoloboev)

This project is still in its early stages but I am certain as it gets traction and people actually start both using and contributing content to it, the popularity will grow. As more people visit and spend time exploring these mind maps, the cost of maintaining and hosting thousands of these mind maps will grow. I would hate to shut down this project for these reasons. 

I also don't want to put any advertisements or any 'sponsored' content in there that I don't think brings value. I want these study plans to present the most efficient ways one can learn any subject one may want to learn in a guided way.

If you do love using these mind maps, I have started a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/nikitavoloboev) where you can support this work, if you wish. There are also some really cool rewards that come with your support. 💚
